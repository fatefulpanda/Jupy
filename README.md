This project involves the data file vgsales.csv, found on Kaggle.com:

With this data, I first made a bar graph of each Genre and how many games there were. I then continued with making a bar graph for platforms. I then wanted to see each genre's sales for each country, the country categories being, NA, EU, JP, and Other. By doing this I noticed that JP had a bar graph that looked different compared to NA, EU, and Other. 
I then decided to do a Pearson Rank correlation using yellowbrick. I then see that JP is the least correlated and so I continued looking at JP data. 
Before going into JP data, I first made bar graphs showing each country's sales by platform.
Moving forward, after cleaning up the data, I decided to see how many RPG games were made in Japan over the years. After doing some regression, we see that RPG games on consoles have been on a decline over the years. I made the conclusion that this data cannot be used to determine correctly how many RPG games are sold in JP because of the mobile gaming market, as it is on the rise and this data doesnt include mobile as a console. 
I ended the project with seeing which publisher made the most RPG games with a line graph and condensing the data to see who made more than 40 games, since there were so many publishers.
